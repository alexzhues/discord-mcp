| You want to… | Discord MCP provides |
| --- | --- |
| Run a community | Messages, threads, forums, roles, events, polls, and onboarding |
| Moderate a server | Permission checks, role audits, bans, and AutoMod |
| Build a server from a prompt | A blueprint to preview and approve, resumable execution, and final Discord readback |
| Extend your bot | Slash commands, interactions, webhooks, and application emojis |
| Improve an existing server | Preview bounded edits, inspect member access, preserve IDs, resume, and restore selected configuration changes |
| Read a conversation with sources | Gather bounded channel/thread history and replies with Discord citations and explicit coverage |
| Run a background workflow | Start a durable sequence, inspect progress, cancel cooperatively, and resume after reviewing checkpoints |

For a complete server build, <a href="https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/start/activity-evidence/"><strong>Get a verified result</strong></a>: review the plan, approve it, then inspect Activity Evidence from the final readback.

<h2 align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/main/.github/assets/readme/section-quick-start.svg" alt="Quick start" width="720" /></h2>

Requires **Node.js 22.12+** and [your own Discord bot](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/start/create-discord-bot/) installed in a server you control. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

```bash
npm install -g @discord-mcp/cli
```

Set the bot token in your terminal:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export DISCORD_TOKEN="Bot YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:DISCORD_TOKEN = "Bot YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
```

Generate a client configuration and verify the connection (Codex example):

```bash
discord-mcp setup --profile devbot --client codex
discord-mcp doctor --profile devbot --online
discord-mcp smoke --profile devbot
```

`setup` verifies your bot, selects a server boundary, and saves a non-secret profile. **Apply the generated configuration to your AI client**; setup does not edit it for you. Launch the client with `DISCORD_TOKEN` available in its environment. The smoke check above does not change Discord.

See [client setup](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/start/client-setup/) for Claude, Codex, Cursor, VS Code/GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, Zed, OpenCode, Devin Local, and other clients, plus desktop-app token setup.

- **Your bot, your permissions.** Guild and tool-category allowlists constrain access. Keep bot tokens out of client config files and source control.
- **Preview first.** Guided `setup` defaults to `MCP_WRITE_MODE=preview`, which blocks all mutations. Direct `serve` defaults to allowing ordinary writes; `MCP_DRY_RUN` covers only confirmation-gated destructive tools. See [safety controls](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/reference/config/safety/) before enabling writes.
- **Local by default.** Run over stdio, or self-host a bearer-protected Streamable HTTP endpoint behind HTTPS. See [remote MCP setup](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/operations/openai/).

<summary>Inspect the tool catalog without a bot token</summary>

```bash
discord-mcp catalog --check
discord-mcp catalog --check --json
```

Validates the real local MCP catalog with no token, no Discord or other network request, and no Discord write. This is not Activity Evidence and does not verify a live connection. Continue with [setup](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/start/) to use your bot. See the [catalog contract](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/start/installation/#optional-catalog-check) for JSON output. The Docker image defaults to catalog-only mode; bot operations require `serve` and your own credentials.

**Pre-1.0.** Check [releases](https://github.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/releases) and [v1.0 readiness](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/reference/v1-readiness/) for current stability commitments.

Ask questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/discussions), share a voluntary [outcome report](https://github.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/issues/new?template=verified-outcome.yml), or follow the [external documentation review](https://cappyeo.github.io/discord-mcp/reference/external-documentation-review/) and [submit feedback](https://github.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/issues/new?template=documentation-review.yml). Never include a bot token, client configuration, private Discord data, or unredacted logs. Report vulnerabilities [privately](https://github.com/cappyeo/discord-mcp/security/advisories/new).

To develop locally, run `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, then `pnpm test`. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md); use [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to inspect tool discovery.
